✅ Problem 1: Rate-Limited File Upload API

Build an Express.js API that allows users to upload image files, but with the following constraints:

Only files of type jpg / png are allowed.

Maximum file size = 2 MB.

A single user (identified by userId in headers) can upload only 5 files per hour.

If the limit is exceeded, return HTTP status:
429 Too Many Requests

Store uploaded files in a folder named uploads/.
