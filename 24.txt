🚀 Problem 2 — Upload Files Using Multer + Validate File Type
📝 Problem Statement:

Create an Express API that:

Accepts file uploads using multer.

Only allows images (jpg, jpeg, png).

Rejects any other file with status 400 and message:
{ error: "Invalid file type" }

Upload route should be:
POST /upload

Successfully upload should return:
{ success: true, filename: "..." }
