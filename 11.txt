🚀 1️⃣ Rate Limiting Middleware

Concepts: Express Middleware, Request Handling, Caching (Map/Redis)

Problem:
Build a custom rate-limiter in Express.js that restricts each user (based on IP) to a maximum of 100 requests per 15 minutes.

Requirements:

If a user exceeds the limit, respond with status 429 (Too Many Requests) and a message like:
"Rate limit exceeded. Try again after 15 minutes."

Maintain count using an in-memory store (like Map) or a Redis store.

Apply it globally to all routes.

Hint:
Use middleware that checks timestamps and counts per IP before proceeding.
