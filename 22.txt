✅ Problem 2: Build a User Authentication Middleware
Problem Statement

Create an Express.js server that restricts access to certain routes using a custom authentication middleware.

✔️ Requirements

Create a middleware authMiddleware that:

Checks for header:
Authorization: Bearer SECRET123

If the token is missing or wrong → return 401 Unauthorized

Public Route:

GET /public → returns "Welcome to the public API"

Protected Route:

GET /dashboard → only accessible if token is correct

Returns user dashboard data like:

{ "user": "John Doe", "role": "admin" }

✔️ Constraints

No database

Only header-based auth

Use Express.js middleware structure
