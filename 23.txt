🚀 Problem 1 — Build a Request Rate Limiter Middleware (Express + Custom Logic)
📝 Problem Statement:

Create an Express server and implement a custom rate limiter middleware without using any external libraries.

Requirements:

A user (identified by IP) can make max 5 requests per minute.

If they exceed the limit:

Return status 429

Return { error: "Too many requests" }

Reset counters every minute.

Apply middleware only to routes beginning with /api.

🔥 Expected Output Example
GET /api/data  → allowed  
GET /api/data  → allowed  
6th request → { error: "Too many requests" }
