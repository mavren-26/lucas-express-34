⚙️ 2️⃣ File Upload with Validation

Concepts: Express Router, Multer, Middleware, Error Handling

Problem:
Create an Express API that allows users to upload a profile picture.
You must:

Accept only .jpg, .jpeg, or .png files.

Reject files larger than 2MB.

Store the uploaded file inside an uploads/ folder.

Return a JSON response like:

{
  "message": "Upload successful",
  "filename": "profile_1234.png"
}


Hint:
Use multer for handling multipart form-data and create custom validation logic.
