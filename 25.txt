✅ Problem 1 — Build a Custom Middleware to Log Request Time & Route
Problem Statement

Create an Express middleware that:

Logs:

HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)

Route URL (/login, /users)

Time taken to process the request (in ms)

Should log after the request completes.

Apply the middleware globally.

Your output should look like:

POST /login  -  12ms
GET /profile -  3ms
